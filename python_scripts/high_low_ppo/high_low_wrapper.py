    This environment provides a standardized interface for the multi-player trading game
    where players with asymmetric information trade contracts that settle at either
    high or low values based on randomly drawn contract values.
    
    Player Roles:
        - ValueCheaters (2): Know one of the candidate contract values
        - HighLowCheater (1): Knows whether settlement will be "high" or "low"
        - Customers (remaining): Have target positions they want to achieve

        - Game setup & private info (11 elements):

        - Public information (dynamic):
